This website was built in 2017 for a friend starting a brewery in Oklahoma City. 

This website was created with Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, all built from scratch. 
The website for Stonecloud Brewing Company has been updated in recent years, and the original website can
be found in the "Internet Archive" through the following link. https://web.archive.org/web/20170715023213/https://stonecloudbrewing.com/the-sunshine-building/
